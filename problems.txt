Framework : Express.js,nodejs
package : moment (npm i moment) for date and time
approach : create trigger function in which firstly i stored data in one variable eventdata which is coming 
            from request body.
            Then one check for request body.
            use for loop to iterate over event array and converting date and time with moment.format(y.m.d.h.m.s)
            then check if schedule time is less then current date and time. then i got problem.

problem :  then i got problem how to initiate function for future time but then i calculate difference between
            current time and schedule time and add delay time as string length(calculate text length and reverse function used ) .
            Used set timeout function for delay .
            for backward string i used reverse built-in method.
